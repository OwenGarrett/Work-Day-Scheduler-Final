# Work-Day-Scheduler-Final

Thank you for taking the time to review my Work Day Scheduler app. In this app you will be able to keep track of your tasks during office hours; 9am-5pm. 

You will be able to:

See a time stamp of the date and time when you opened the app

See a color coded work day scheduler for the hours of 9am-5pm

Dynamic styling that indicates the time of day. Red for present hour; green for future; grey for the past. 

You will be able to write tasks in each hour's text area and save your activity so that when you refresh the page, the activity will still appear. 

Thanks for checking out my app!
